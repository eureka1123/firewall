Testing:
	- Did not test rigorously due to time constraint
	- Used given example to test for accuracy 
	- should check for speed with large set of rules
		- wrote code to generate large set of rules
	- tested in shell and did not write script

Optimization (not implemented):
	- multithreading while checking rules

Preferred Team: Data Team
